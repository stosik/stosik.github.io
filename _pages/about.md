Software Engineer from Poland, working in JVM ecosystem since 2016.

Programming has been a big passion of mine since I remember, probably because of the
constant learning curve which seems to only get steeper as the one progresses in the
software engineer career. Overcoming difficulties and finding optimal solutions to the user problems
seems like never ending exercise which I hope to master (one day).

I invite you to join me in this adventure where I try to explain concepts, problems and attach to them
feasible solutions which sometimes are obvious, other times not really.
