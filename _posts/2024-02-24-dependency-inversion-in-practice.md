# Introduction
Upon recently re-reading `Clean Architecture` by Robert C. Martin I went through whole Part III where different
design principles are discussed. Although I found all of them interestingly described when it comes to applicability
in wider scope than usually they are discussed (mostly `SOLID` principles), I believe author put a lot of attention to
one specific principle which stands for "D" in `SOLID` and is described as "Dependency Inversion Principle" (`DIP`).

Let's look at the standard definition of it:
> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

To simply put it, `DIP` encourages the use of abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) to decouple high-level
and low-level components in a system, promoting a more flexible and extensible architecture.

# Problem statement
Before jumping into the application of Dependency Inversion in practice, let's first define the problem we would like
to solve. One of the many forms we can observe violation of `DIP` is when we tightly couple high-level and low-level
components, making impossible to change one without affecting the other.

Below we can observe direct `DIP` violation:

```kotlin
class BillingService {
    private val processor = PayPalPaymentProcessor()

    fun charge() {
        processor.process()
    }
}

class PayPalPaymentProcessor {
    fun process() {
        println("Processing PayPal payment")
    }
}
```

What went wrong here? The `BillingService` (high-level) class is tightly coupled with `PayPalPaymentProcessor`
(low-level) class. High-level component depends on a concrete implementation of low-level component, every change
in `PayPalPaymentProcessor` class will directly affect necessity of changes in `BillingService` class. Such structure 
not only makes future changes difficult but also makes testing harder. Can we do better? Yes, we can.

Above example can be illustrated with a simple dependency graph:

## Solution

Let's refactor above example to see how it could be solved.

```kotlin
class BillingService(private val processor: PaymentProcessor) {
    
    fun charge() {
        processor.process()
    }
}

interface PaymentProcessor {
    fun process()
}

class PayPalPaymentProcessor: PaymentProcessor {
    fun process() {
        println("Processing PayPal payment")
    }
}
```

What just happened here? We introduced an interface `PaymentProcessor` which is implemented by `PayPalPaymentProcessor` 
class. We also changed `BillingService` class to accept `PaymentProcessor` as a constructor parameter. This way,
we not only applied directly `DIP` but also using technique called `Dependency Injection` enabled the possibility to
inject different implementations and interchangeability of `PaymentProcessor` implementation. Now, `BillingService`
class is not dependent on a concrete implementation of payment processor, it's dependent on an abstraction (interface),
the same applies to `PayPalPaymentProcessor` class which by implementing `PaymentProcessor` interface is not dependent
on `BillingService` class but the interface it implements.

After applying above changes, we can see that direction of our dependency graph has changed. Illustration below shows
that both (low and high-level) components point to the abstraction (interface) instead of pointing to each other
as before. We will expand direction of dependencies in the next section.

# Dependency Inversion in Architecture

The example provided above may not offer groundbreaking insights to many of us. Using interfaces as abstractions
to decouple high-level and low-level components is a common practice. However, the real challenge arises when
attempting to apply the Dependency Inversion Principle to higher-level concepts such as architecture.
In his book `Clean Architecture` Robert C. Martin describes how the application of `DIP` can lead to the creation
of more flexible and maintainable architecture. This is achieved by placing low-level infrastructure components
behind a fine line of abstractions, thus keeping the core business logic independent of any external frameworks
or libraries.

This particular approach to designing the architecture of our systems can be found in various sources under different
names, such as `Ports and Adapters`, `Hexagonal Architecture`, and `Clean Architecture`. The underlying idea behind
all of these approaches remains consistent: to keep the core business logic as the primary focus of the service,
free from unnecessary entanglement with external dependencies.

This architectural style applies the Dependency Inversion Principle as an additional restriction on the
multiple layers of an application. As a result, all dependencies point towards the center, where the high-level
policy logic should reside. Therefore, the center is where we hope to find the domain model, the core functionality
of the application. Achieving `DIP` in a layered architecture is done by creating abstract interfaces for the low-level
details. These low-level details are typically referred to as adapters and sit at the boundary of your system.
The abstractions are called ports and are part of the domain layer.

Dependency Inversion Principle is also useful mechanism when it comes 

## Acyclic Dependencies Principle

One of the few things which came to me as a surprise when reading `Clean Architecture` was the existence in literature
of principle such as `Acyclic Dependencies Principle` (ADP). The principle states:

> allow no cycles in your component dependency graph

Robert C. Martin introduces two challenges when implementing systems:
- morning after syndrome: code you were working on earlier doesn't work in future because another developer changed 
a component elsewhere
- the weekly build: it is common in medium Size projects. It works, all the developers ignore each other for the first
four days of the week. They all work on private copies of code and donâ€™t worry about integrating their work on
a collective basis. Then on the fifth day i.e on Friday, all of them integrate all their changes and build the system

It is also worth mentioning that keeping the structure of the components in form of acyclic direct graph (DAG)
eliminates the possibility of encountering circular dependencies. This particular problem is usually interesting when it
comes to building and deployment of particular components of the system. Having circular dependency between components
causes multiple modules (units of deployment) to be built even one of them has not changed.

If we added a dependency on the Auth layer to the Entities, we would also incur a need to build the Interactors,
which itself requires that Entities are build beforehand. Meaning that this specific module can not be developed
in isolation anymore.

![DAG](../assets/dip/dip-cycle.png "Cycle in the dependency graph")

Can we prevent that? Of course.

### Breaking the cycle

One of the most commons ways to deal with such situation is to introduce an abstraction (in form of interface) which
we can use to reverse the dependency direction. Sounds familiar? Yes, it's exactly what Dependency Inversion Principle
is about.

![DIP](../assets/dip/dip-cycle-break.png "Breaking the cycle")

By introducing `IPermission` interface, we reversed the direction of module dependency. What made possible to break the
cycle in our dependency graph, and make `Auth` module independent of `Entities`. Now, they can be built and reason about
separately.

# Conclusions

Dependency Inversion Principle is a powerful tool that can be used to create more flexible and maintainable systems.
By using abstractions to decouple high-level and low-level components, we can create create solutions which are easily
testable, loosely coupled and easy to maintain.
